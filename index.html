	<h1>What is Stay (2005) about?</h1>
	<p>Exactly.</p>
	<p><em>What?</em> I'm hearing you say, but I mean it. That's EXACTLY what the movie is about.</p>
	<p>I'm the kind of spoiler-phobic person who preffers not to even watch previews before I watch a film - too often the entire story is summarized in what is supposed to be a sneak peak. However, with the movie Stay it is absolutely <strong>NECISSARY</strong> to go in blind, knowing little or nothing about what the story is, and what is supposed to be happening. I so enjoyed this movie because it's surrealism left me just slightly suspicious something strange was going on, and I spent the entire movie trying to figure out what was going on. </p>
	<p>What is Stay about? Stay is about figuring out what Stay is about. And I love it for that.</p>
